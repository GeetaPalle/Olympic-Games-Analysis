# Olympic Games Analytics Dashboard

The Olympic Games represent the pinnacle of global sports, and analyzing performance data helps identify trends, patterns, and strategies for success.
This project leverages Power BI for interactive KPIs and Tableau for advanced visual analytics, offering:

- Medal distribution analysis. (Gold, Silver, Bronze)

- Country-wise and sport-wise medal trends.

- Age group performance & gender diversity.

- Athlete-level performance insights.

Both tools were used to build dashboards for comprehensive storytelling and decision-making.
